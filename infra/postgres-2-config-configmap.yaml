    # PostgreSQL User Name Maps
    # =========================
    #
    # ---------------
    # Mapping Records
    # ---------------
    #
    # Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation, chapter "Client
    # Authentication" for a complete description.  A short synopsis
    # follows.
    #
    # This file controls PostgreSQL user name mapping.  It maps external
    # user names to their corresponding PostgreSQL user names.  Records
    # are of the form:
    #
    # MAPNAME  SYSTEM-USERNAME  PG-USERNAME
    #
    # (The uppercase quantities must be replaced by actual values.)
    #
    # MAPNAME is the (otherwise freely chosen) map name that was used in
    # pg_hba.conf.  SYSTEM-USERNAME is the detected user name of the
    # client.  PG-USERNAME is the requested PostgreSQL user name.  The
    # existence of a record specifies that SYSTEM-USERNAME may connect as
    # PG-USERNAME.
    #
    # If SYSTEM-USERNAME starts with a slash (/), it will be treated as a
    # regular expression.  Optionally this can contain a capture (a
    # parenthesized subexpression).  The substring matching the capture
    # will be substituted for \1 (backslash-one) if present in
    # PG-USERNAME.
    #
    # PG-USERNAME can be "all", a user name, a group name prefixed with "+", or
    # a regular expression (if it starts with a slash (/)).  If it is a regular
    # expression, the substring matching with \1 has no effect.
    #
    # Multiple maps may be specified in this file and used by pg_hba.conf.
    #
    # No map names are defined in the default configuration.  If all
    # system user names and PostgreSQL user names are the same, you don't
    # need anything in this file.
    #
    # ---------------
    # Include Records
    # ---------------
    #
    # This file allows the inclusion of external files or directories holding
    # more records, using the following keywords:
    #
    # include           FILE
    # include_if_exists FILE
    # include_dir       DIRECTORY
    #
    # FILE is the file name to include, and DIR is the directory name containing
    # the file(s) to include.  Any file in a directory will be loaded if suffixed
    # with ".conf".  The files of a directory are ordered by name.
    # include_if_exists ignores missing files.  FILE and DIRECTORY can be
    # specified as a relative or an absolute path, and can be double-quoted if
    # they contain spaces.
    #
    # -------------------------------
    # Miscellaneous
    # -------------------------------
    #
    # This file is read on server startup and when the postmaster receives
    # a SIGHUP signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have
    # to SIGHUP the postmaster for the changes to take effect.  You can
    # use "pg_ctl reload" to do that.

    # Put your actual configuration here
    # ----------------------------------

    # MAPNAME       SYSTEM-USERNAME         PG-USERNAME
